            <p>Welcome to the Portfolio of Ethan Hassenfeld. As of now you have stumbled onto a different type of Resume than normal.
                I have set this up in order to show the positiblities of what an Engineer can do as well as what I have done thus far
                as a UX/UI designer. These are small accomplishments that I am proud to share and I hope you can look at these and appreciate
                the time and effort I have put into them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So far the below is a compilation of school taught introduction to how a ficticious company, Rhino Splits, has approached me to create an 
                app for them. Below is the process that I have undergone as well as the published research and method I would approach 
                any other project. Please note that all of the data and information below would be what I would share client facing and there was an 
                exhaustive attempt to make this project as real as possible. </p>

            <p>In my apprach to this class, I brought along with me my engineering princibles and developed an understanding in regards
                to the different possibilities in regards to what I see and how I apprached things. Below are a couple of links to articles 
                that I was involved in previously at my prior employment. </p><br>

        <p>Rhino Splits is my main example as of now. This was derived from a school project at Nashville Software School. I engaged in the 
            process I would undergo as if a client would have approached me with the same desired that met my school project. </p><br>
