            <section>
                <p>A company by the name of Rhino Splits has recently contacted me and I have gone thru the necessary steps to make
                    the below product a reality. I was able to accomplish all of the below without anyone specifically on my team but was able to 
                    bounce ideas off of and maintain my clients wishes and requirements. Overall, I was able to succeed in delivering 
                    a working framework as well as get the design to the final renderings though no launch is imminent. This product did not make
                    it to market for a couple of reasons that will be discussed at a later time.

                <p>The main ask from the company Rhino Splits is to investigate and create a new peer-to-peer payment app that would allow the 
                    user to seamlessly communicate with their friends and send / receive funds that were made. Their hope was to be the 
                    Apple of the mobile payment platforms. Further more, the approach, specific plans, feels and overall design of this was 
                    left vague and intended to be driven more on need. With the lofty goal in mind, I immediately began my research and 
                    developed a necessary attach plan to create what was asked for.
